== Main loop

The functions described in this section are to be used in the application's main event loop.
In particular, the application is expected to repeatedly call the <<trigger, trigger>>( ) function in
its event loop.

[[trigger]]
* _tnext_ = *trigger*( ) +
[small]#Executes the callbacks for all the timers that are expired. +
The application is expected to call the _trigger( )_ function again no later than at _tnext_ (a <<_system_time, point in time>>, or _math.huge_ if no timers are running).#

[[tnext]]
* _tnext_ = *tnext*( ) +
[small]#Returns the current _tnext_ value (see _<<trigger, trigger>>( )_).#
