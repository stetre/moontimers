[[timers]]
== Timer objects

The application can create and manage timers using the functions and methods described below.

[[timer_new]]
* _timer_ = *new*(_duration_, _func_) +
[small]#Creates a new timer object. +
_duration_: the timer's default timeout (seconds), +
_func_: the timer's callback (a Lua function). +
The _func_ callback is executed when the timer expires as *func(timer, exptime)*, where _exptime_
is the actual expiration time.#

[[timer_free]]
* _timer_++:++*free*( ) +
[small]#Deletes _timer_. Also stops it, if it is running.#

[[timer_start]]
* _exptime_ = _timer_++:++*start*([_exptime_]) +
[small]#Starts _timer_ so to expire at the <<_system_time, point in time>>
given by _exptime_ (default:  _exptime_ = _<<now,now>>( )+duration_). +
Calling this function may change the current <<tnext, _tnext_>> value.#

[[timer_stop]]
* _timer_++:++*stop*( ) +
[small]#Stops _timer_. 
If the timer is not running, this function has no effects and generates no errors.#

[[timer_running]]
* _boolean_, _exptime_ = _timer_++:++*is_running*( ) +
[small]#If _timer_ is running, returns _true_, _exptime_. +
If _timer_ is not running, returns _false_, _math.huge_.#

[[timer_set]]
* _timer_++:++*set_duration*(_duration_) +
_timer_++:++*set_callback*(_func_) +
[small]#Set the timer's default timeout, and its callback (see _<<timer_new, new>>( )_).#
