== System time

All timestamps accepted or returned by functions and methods in this module
refer to the *system time* given by the <<now, now>>(&nbsp;) function described below.

The system time is relative to an unspecified point in the past that depends on the
underlying function used to retrieve time from the operating system.

[[now]]
* _timestamp_ = *now*( ) +
[small]#Returns the current system time, in seconds.#

[[since]]
* _dt_ = *since*(_timestamp_) +
[small]#Returns the time elapsed from the point in time given by _timestamp_.#
