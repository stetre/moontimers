== Overview

This module extends Lua with timers.

The application can create multiple <<timers, timer>> objects associating a callback function
with each, and then start them to expire at a future point in time, and possibly stop them
before their expiration.

The application is then expected to repeatedly call the <<trigger, trigger>>( ) function in its
main event loop. This function checks for expired timers and executes their callback.

A simple example is shown below:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
local timers = require("moontimers")

local duration = 2 -- seconds
local function callback(timer, exptime)
   print(string.format("timer expired, system time = %f", timers.now()))
   -- Restart the timer:
   timer:start(exptime+duration)
end

-- Create a timer
local t1 = timers.new(duration, callback)

-- Start it:
t1:start()

-- Event loop:
while true do
   timers.trigger()
end
----
